## Code
There are two colab notebooks. The first one is ADL_Project_Data_Processing.ipynb and it contains the code for data processing part. The second one is ADL_Project_Model_and_Results.ipynb and it contains code for model and results part. You need first run ADL_Project_Data_Processing.ipynb, then run ADL_Project_Model_and_Results.ipynb to get the final result.
